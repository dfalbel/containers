# Available containers

Our ultimate goal is to have containers that match all [primary CRAN Linux
systems](https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_flavors.html) and all
[extra CRAN checks](https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_issue_kinds.html).

Currently we have the following containers:

| CRAN name | Description                                        | Details                           |
|:----------|:---------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------|
|ATLAS      | Tests with alternative BLAS/LAPACK implementations | [Details](containers.html#atlas)  |
|gcc13      | Checks with GCC trunk aka 13.0                     | [Details](containers.html#gcc-13) |
|noLD       | Tests without long double                          | [Details](containers.html$nold)   |

All containers are available from
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/rhub) and from
[Github Packages](https://github.com/orgs/r-hub/packages?repo_name=containers).

See the [containers page](containers.html) for more data about the
containers.

# Usage

You can use these containers [on your machine](local.html), or on
[GitHub Actions](gha.html).
